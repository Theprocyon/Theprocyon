## ðŸ§­ About Me

I am an engineer focusing on embedded systems and power electronics.  
For the past 3 years, I have been working as a hardware engineer, mainly involved in designing and developing PCBs for power electronics applications.  
Currently, I am researching control systems for power converters, with a particular interest in **traction inverters** for electric drives.
